# Cursor Project Rules

project_name: Idea

code_generation:
  style:
    - Prefer explicit, descriptive names; avoid abbreviations
    - Keep functions small with early returns
    - Add comments only for non-obvious rationale and edge cases
    - Match existing formatting; do not reformat unrelated code
  typescript:
    - Enable strict typing; avoid any and unsafe casts
    - Prefer composition over inheritance
    - Keep side effects out of modules; export pure functions when possible

editing:
  - Preserve existing indentation (tabs vs spaces) and width
  - Do not introduce broad refactors with small edits
  - Keep diffs minimal and targeted

security:
  - Never commit secrets or tokens
  - Validate and sanitize inputs on boundaries

performance:
  - Avoid unnecessary reactivity and watchers; use computed where possible
  - Memoize expensive computations if rerun often

tests:
  - Prefer unit tests close to code; name with .test.ts
  - Keep tests deterministic; avoid network and time flakiness

reviews:
  - Explain non-trivial decisions in PR descriptions
  - Link related issues and context

tools:
  - Run lint and typecheck before committing
  - Use lint-staged to format staged files with Prettier
